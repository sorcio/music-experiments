Tuning/Intervals
================

* Why There are Twelve Notes in Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9CPoe5LnM

  * an `octave <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave>`_
    is an interval with a frequency ratio of 2:1 (e.g. A4 and A5)
  * a `perfect fifth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth>`_
    is an interval with a frequency ratio of 3:2
  * the `Pythagorean tuning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning>`_
    uses the 3:2 ratio
  * the `Equal temperament <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament>`_
    divides the octave in 12 equal steps
  * if we build a scale by using a 3:2 ratio, the frequencies for the octaves
    don't match an exact 2:1 ratio
  * therefore, the equal temperament is now commonly used in Western music

Nomenclature
============

These links describe the names used in the code and their intended meaning.

* `Note value <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value>`_: a fraction that
  represent the relative duration of a note.
* `Melody <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody>`_: a sequence of notes with
  a note value.
* `Rhythm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm>`_: a sequence of note values
  as fractions.
* `Notes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note>`_: a sequence of notes
  without note values.
